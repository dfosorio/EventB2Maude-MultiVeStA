# EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA

The EventB2Maude tool, originally presented in the following [github repository](https://github.com/carlosolarte/EventB2Maude), allows to translate probabilistic Event-B models to probabilistic rewrite theories in Maude, that are verifiable in PVeStA, based on the theory presented [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05813). This repository contains a modified version of the previously mentioned tool, that allows the verification of the translated models with the [MultiVeStA](https://github.com/andrea-vandin/MultiVeStA) tool. Furthermore, a [bachelors thesis document](https://github.com/dfosorio/Thesis/blob/main/Document/main.pdf) can be consulted for more detailed information on the theoretical ad technical aspects behind the tool.

## Project Structure
The project is divided in the following folders:
- The [parser](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/parser) folder, contains the python files used for the translation of the probabilistic Event-B models to probabilistic Maude. The [EventBLexer.py](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/blob/main/parser/EventBLexer.py), [EventBListener.py](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/blob/main/parser/EventBListener.py) and [EventBParser.py](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/blob/main/parser/EventBParser.py) where generated by the [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) program, and are used by the [B2Maude.py](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/blob/main/parser/B2Maude.py) file, which contains all the logic for the compilation and translation of the probabilistic Event-B models to probabilistic Maude. The defined grammar for the compilation of the Event-B models is defined in the [EventB.g4](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/blob/main/parser/EventB.g4) file.



- As its name suggests it, the [MultiVeStA](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/MultiVeStA) folder contains the MultiVeStA tool. The original download link of this program can be found [here](https://github.com/andrea-vandin/MultiVeStA/wiki/Integration-with-PMaude-specification). The structure of the MultiVeStA folder tool is the following:
  - The [Maude-3.0+yices2-linux](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/MultiVeStA/Maude-3.0%2Byices2-linux) contains the Maude program (Maude executable and related other related files)
  - The [m-theory](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/MultiVeStA/m-theory) folder contains the necessary Maude theory for the encoded probabilistic Event-B models 



- The [CS1_DiceProgram](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/CS1_DiceProgram), [CS2_BRetrans5](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/CS2_BRetrans5) and [CS3_PNL](https://github.com/dfosorio/EventB2Maude-MultiVeStA/tree/main/CS3_PNL) are some case study folders for the tool, with the following structure:
  - A **Models** folder that contains the probabilistic Event-b models (files with .b extension) and the resulting probabilistic Maude models (files with .maude extension) after translating them with the parser.
  - A **MultiQuatTEx** folder with the MultiQuatTEx files that specify the quantitative temporal logic formulas that were evaluated in the simulations.
  - A **Results** folder with the results returned by MultiVeStA after running the simulations with the models and MultiQuatTEx formulas.
  - A **runMultivestaLinux64.sh** file used to execute the simulations using MultiVeStA, that specify the simulation parameters.
